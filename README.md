3D Bin Packing: The Tetris of Logistics

3D bin packing is a mathematical optimization problem whereby objects of different sizes and shapes are packed into a limited number of three-dimensional containers (bins) with the aim of maximizing space utilization and minimizing empty space.
The problem arises in various scenarios, such as manufacturing, packaging, and transportation, where efficient usage of space becomes critical to reducing costs and raising the profitability of transported goods. Many constraints must be followed: Volume Constraint, Collision Avoidance, Stability, Orientation/Rotation, and Weight Distribution.
The GIL's packer solver is a sophisticated 3D bin-packing system meant for efficiently finding an optimum way of placing boxes of various sizes within a given container space. The solver makes use of collision detection, stability verification, and multiple box orientations for maximum utilization of space with load balance. It also makes use of algorithms that would place heavier items at the base, as shown in the picture: heavy boxes â€“ colder colors- keep lighter boxes -warm colors-. Additionally, it interfaces with Excel for data input, since users can now input and manipulate packing data directly from Excel worksheets. It generates detailed PDF reports, containing container efficiency information, details on packed boxes, and operator notes. 
This is an excellent tool in the logistics and warehousing supply chain for optimizing space, where the actual efficient packing would result in saving transport costs by increasing workflow efficiency.
